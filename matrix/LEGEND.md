### Hydrogen Chains and Cycles
Matrices with filename "{c?}H{n}{E|S}{J|B|P}{m?}.npy" correspond to hydrogen toy models.

The label "H{N}" indicates a line of N equally-spaced hydrogens,
    while  "cH{N}" indicates a ring.

The next letter indicates whether the geometry is near equilibrium (E) or stretched (S).
For stretched geometries, the distance between nearest neighbors is 3.0Å.
For equilibrium geometries, the geomtries are NOT optimized, so they are only _close_ to equilibrium.
The exact seaparations are given in the section below.

The next letter indicates the qubit mapping used:
    Jordan-Wigner (J), Bravyi-Kitaev (B) or parity (P).
The presence of an m after the mapping indicates whether a two-qubit tapering was applied
    to account for conservation of particles in each spin sector.
